# What-cha-Think

## Project Description

What-cha-Think is an Airtable and React build where the user is able to leave reviews for various forms of entertainment. From the homepage, the user is able to navigate to and click on an icon that leads to a corresponding page for film, television or sporting-event reviews. Each respective page will lead to a feed of past reviews and a form to create new reviews. Each review will be deletable.

                "rating": 5,
                "opinion": "A classic cinematic theme executed perfectly. The acting, spearheaded by Marlon Brando, made the story memorable. "
            },
            "createdTime": "2020-10-09T00:27:04.000Z"

                "opinion": "This movie was not very good in terms of cinematic quality, however it smells of nostalgia which I can't help but enjoy every July 4th. "
            },
            "createdTime": "2020-10-09T00:27:04.000Z"
        }
